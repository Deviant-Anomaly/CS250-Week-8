Week 8 Portfolio Assignment
* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    User stories create perspective from the end user about what features they would like to see implemented or changed. User stories can provide specfic what's and why's to each feature, and really the developer team fills in the "how". If they are detailed enough, you can get what you need for most, if not all, of a task; other times you may need to request your Product Owner meet with clients for more specifics if there are any blanks thast need filled in.

* How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    My approach for developing programs is still a bit messy, as I still struggle with "where should I start" once I open it. I feel like having a task board and sorting specific things into "level of priority" will start helping though. I feel like as I get better at designating what is high and low in terms of priority. I may create a task board too just for projects to help myself out. Seems ridiculous not to think of it before this with me being as visual of a person I am. 

* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    Being a good team member in software development requires effective communication with your team, and a sense of self-motivation, as being on a developer team gives you a lot of independence. If you aren't reliable to get your work done, it effects the entire team negatively. Being able to admit when you're struggling is also important, as you have a team who can help you, though it isn't always easy to stand in front of a group and announce your struggles publicly, it's something that needs to be done to help improve the efficiency of the team as a whole.
